# Design and Impress

This was My first draft at a portfolio for showcasing Front-end React and css skills 


Below I have some videos showing the project and showing the animations


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Shown below is the landing Home Page which shows a little bit of information on me and some of my hobbies and what drove this project.

After landing on the Hame page and Reading through some of the info if you like.

You can then navigate using the Navbar to the animations page with examples of some of the animations that I can create and showcase in this project.

After checking out the animation examples and enjoying them you can then navigate to the Request Page

On the Request page you can see prior request that have been made and you can even leave one of your own

BUT you can only leave a request if you log in.

Navigating to the log in page you can sign up if you are new or log in if you are already a user


Here is a example of signing up and logging in

After logging in you can now head back to the Request page and make your own request should you have one like in this example.
